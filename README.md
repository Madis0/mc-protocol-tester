# Minecraft Protocol Tester

Filters out servers that *actually* have 1.9 or higher as a base from a list of IP-protocol file you specify.

Requires [mcstatus](https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus) - `pip install mcstatus`

To use, place a file called `servers.txt` in the same folder with server IPs in separate rows and run `portfinder.py`.

For an interactive CLI, use `lite.py`.

For an active port finder, use `finder.py`.
