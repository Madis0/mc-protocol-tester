# Minecraft Protocol Tester

Filters out servers that *actually* have 1.9 or higher as a base from a list of IP-protocol file you specify.

Requires [mcstatus](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus) - `pip install mcstatus`

* To use, place a file called `servers.txt` in the same folder with server IPs in separate rows and run `portfinder.py`.
* To use it just for a single server, use the interactive CLI `lite.py`.
* For an active port finder, use (at your own risk!) `finder.py`.
