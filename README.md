# MC 1.9 servers

Filters out servers that *actually* have 1.9 or higher as a base from a list of IP-protocol file you specify.

Requires [mcstatus](https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus) - `pip install mcstatus`

To use, place a file called `servers.txt` in the same folder with server IPs in separate rows.
